The report contains a wealth of information about the Canadian job market, categorized by the demographic, class of worker (private sector employee, public sector employee, self-employed), industry, and province.

### Consumer Price Index 

Statistics Canada releases a [monthly report](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/150123/dq150123a-eng.htm) on the [consumer price index](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100214/how-cost-living-index-calculated.asp) (CPI) that measures inflation at the consumer level. The index is constructed by comparing changes over time in a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by consumers.

###  RBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index - PMI 

 Released on the first business day of each month, [this indicator](http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/reports/rbc-purchasing-managers-index.html) of trends in the Canadian manufacturing sector was launched in June 2011 by Royal Bank of Canada, in association with Markit and the Purchasing Management Association of Canada. RBC PMI readings above 50 signal expansion as compared to the previous month, while readings below 50 signal contraction. The monthly survey also tracks other information pertinent to the manufacturing sector, such as changes in output, new orders, employment, inventories, prices, and supplier delivery times.

###  The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index 

 The [Conference Board of Canada's Index of Consumer Confidence](http://www.conferenceboard.ca/topics/economics/consumer_confidence.aspx) measures consumers' levels of optimism in the state of the economy. It is a crucial indicator of near-term sales for consumer product companies in Canada, as well as an indicator of the outlook for the broad economy since consumer demand comprises such a significant part of it. The index is constructed on the basis of responses to four questions by a random sampling of Canadian households. Survey participants are asked how they view their households' current and expected financial positions, their short-term employment outlook, and whether now is a good time to make a major purchase.

###  Ivey Purchasing Managers Index - PMI 

 An index prepared by the Ivey Business School at Western University, the [Ivey PMI](http://iveypmi.uwo.ca/english/) measures the monthly variation in economic activity, as indicated by a panel of purchasing managers across Canada. It is based on responses by these purchasing managers to a single question: "Were your purchases last month in dollars higher, the same, or lower than in the previous month?" An index reading below 50 shows a decrease; a reading above 50 shows an increase. Panel members indicate changes in their organization's activity over five broad categories: purchases, employment, inventories, supplier deliveries, and prices.

###  Housing Starts 

Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) issues a [monthly report](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3410013501) on the sixth working day of every month, showing the previous month's new residential construction activity. The data is presented by region, province, census metropolitan area, and dwelling type (single-detached or multiple-unit). The indicator is an important gauge of the state of the Canadian housing market.

### Home Sales

This key indicator of housing activity is compiled by the [Canadian Real Estate Association](http://creastats.crea.ca) (CREA) and is based on the number of home sales processed through the MLS (Multiple Listing Service) Systems of real estate boards and associations in Canada. The monthly report from the CREA shows the change in home sales across Canada, as well as for major markets, from month to month. The report also includes other important housing-related information, such as the change (as a percentage) in newly listed homes, the national sales-to-new listings ratio, months of housing inventory, the change in the MLS Home Price Index, and the national average price for homes sold within the month.

### Retail Sales

Statistics Canada releases a [monthly report](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/150217/dq150217e-eng.htm) on retail sales activity across Canada, with changes shown on month-over-month and year-over-year bases. The headline number shows the percentage change in national retail sales on a dollar basis; the percentage change in volume terms is also shown. The retail sales figures are shown by industry and for each province or territory, and provide insights into Canadian consumer spending.

### Building Permits 

The [building permits](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3410006601) conducted monthly by Statistics Canada collects data on the value of permits issued by Canadian municipalities for residential and non-residential buildings, as well as the number of residential dwellings authorized. Since building permit issuance is one of the very first steps in the process of construction, the aggregate building permits data are very useful as a leading indicator for assessing the state of the construction industry.

### The Bottom Line

The 12 economic indicators briefly described above show the health of key aspects of Canada's economy: consumer spending, housing, manufacturing, employment, inflation, external trade, and economic growth. Taken together, they provide a comprehensive picture of the state of the Canadian economy.

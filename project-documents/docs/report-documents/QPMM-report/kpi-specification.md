### Discoveries

???+ note "Discovery - Current Process Issues"
	* Cariac Program Abbreviation should read from CCN_Reference database CCN_Facility_Abbreviations table FacilityAbbreviations_1 column
	* For the trend chart on the report pages, since every quarter the report data is based on production data-cut, if hospital users change previous quarter's data via Wait Time application, the trend data on this quarter's report might not match trend data on previous quarter's report

???+ danger "Document - Missing Contents"

	* Specification Excel file doesn't mention the data count by Quarter
	* Pdf report use word 'Elective CATH case', the Specification Excel file uses word 'CATH case'
	* Specification Excel file has no clear statement about Metrics A and B if it should include CATH/Pre-CATH DQ count or not. It should exclude CATH/PreCATH DQ count which is a conclusion after reading current code
	* Specification Excel file uses the same words "Total count of CATH cases at a specific Cardiac Program" as report element definition, it's not accurate. On first two report pages, the count value are not always same even they have same Label "Elective CATH count", this is because that ( Elective CATH case count - CATH DQ count ) does not always equal to ( Elective CATH case count - Pre-CATH DQ count ).

### Discoveries

???+ note "Discovery - Current Process Issues"
	* Page 5: There are manually data filtering and extra rows deletion steps to prepare Lytic Calculated data. Please see Step 2.4 in **Y:\SERVICE DESK\Policies & Procedures\Standard Operating Procedures\Reporting\CS08 - Quarterly Performance Measuremant and Management Data Extract.docx**

???+ danger "Document - Misleading Contents"

	* Specification Excel file doesn't mention the data count by Quarter
	* Specification Excel file uses "Total count of excluded STEMI with a First balloon inflation/Device case count ..." in all aggreate columns on Page 3 and Page 4, it's very misleading that the STEMI cases Total Count is same thing on Page 3 and page 4. But acutally they are not.
	* Specificaiton Excel file has too many aggreate columns that not showing on the report page.
	* Page 3 and 4: The description column content should be more accturate to describe it's for Non-PCI and PPCI STEMI cases

# Executive Summary

## Background
Within the Ontario cardiac system, there are limited platforms or processes provincially that consistently measure and monitor the quality of cardiac care services provided to patients.

As part of CorHealth Ontario’s new corporate strategy, a key strategic direction established for the organization is to measure and report on quality and outcomes for cardiovascular care. As a first step towards this strategic direction, CorHealth plans on initiating a Quality Performance Measurement & Monitoring (QPMM) Cycle with all 20 advanced cardiac programs in Ontario to provide a platform for regular measuring and monitoring of quality metrics for cardiac care across the province. The goal of the QPMM Cycle is to ensure that patients receive high quality cardiac care regardless of
where they live, and where they access care.

## Quality Scorecard
CorHealth has developed this quality scorecard to support the measurement and monitoring of performance of the 20 advanced cardiac programs in Ontario. For the initial year of the QPMM Cycle, two cardiac services have been selected to be part of the scorecard as quality indicators:

1. Timely Access to Reperfusion Therapy for ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), with a focus on providing timely STEMI care in order to reduce harmful delays for patients; and
2. Effective use of Diagnostic Cardiac Catheterization (Cath), with a focus on ensuring effective care for patients who
may require a Cath procedure.

These two services have been selected to be the initial QPMM scorecard indicators because they have been identified as provincial priorities or areas that require system improvement, and are involved in ongoing quality improvement  initiatives currently underway at CorHealth. The selection of these two cardiac quality indicators were developed in consultation with CorHealth’s clinical working groups, Clinical Council, and the MOHLTC

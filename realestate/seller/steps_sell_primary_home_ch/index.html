                <h1 id="10">10步销售房屋指南<a class="headerlink" href="#10" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h2 id="1">步骤1：决定何时出售<a class="headerlink" href="#1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>在房地产业，时机不是一切，但它确实会影响你家的售价。</p>
<h3 id="_1">卖方市场<a class="headerlink" href="#_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>当很多人在寻找房屋但没有多少人可以出售。</p>
<h3 id="_2">买方市场<a class="headerlink" href="#_2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>当有很多待售房屋而且没有多少人购买它们。</p>
<h3 id="_3">季节性<a class="headerlink" href="#_3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>这是指大多数市场的冬季销售往往较慢，而春季销售通常会加快。</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="2">第2步：管理你的钱<a class="headerlink" href="#2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>一桩房产交易，意味着大笔资金流动。不要忘记考虑以下事项：</p>
<h3 id="_4">还清抵押贷款<a class="headerlink" href="#_4" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>这是指使用您出售房屋的收益来偿还您当前的抵押贷款。在开放抵押贷款中，您可以全额支付，无需任何处罚。如果您有封闭抵押贷款，请准备支付罚款。</p>
<h3 id="_5">可转抵押贷款<a class="headerlink" href="#_5" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>可转式抵押意味着您可以现存的抵押贷款购买新房，而不会受到处罚。</p>
<h3 id="_6">资产增值税<a class="headerlink" href="#_6" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>如果您出售度假或投资物业，您需要缴纳资本利得税。</p>
<p>在做出个人财务决策之前，请务必咨询专业财务顾问。</p>
<h2 id="3">步骤3：找个适合您的房地产经纪人。<a class="headerlink" href="#3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>不要简单地选择第一个提出最高要价的房地产经纪人。与多几个人交谈，你很快就会找到适合你的那个。</p>
<h3 id="_7">与熟悉的房地产经纪人合作<a class="headerlink" href="#_7" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>如果您的房地产经纪人在帮助您购买房屋方面做得很好，他或她可能是帮助您出售房屋的好人选。</p>
<h3 id="_8">使用本地房地产经纪人<a class="headerlink" href="#_8" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>记下出售标志的房地产经纪人的姓名和联系方式</li>
<li>请朋友或家人推荐房地产经纪人</li>
<li>直接查访所在地区的房地产公司</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4">步骤4：准备待售房屋。<a class="headerlink" href="#4" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="_9">去除杂乱物<a class="headerlink" href="#_9" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>当你去除房子周围的所有非必要的东西时，你的房子会感觉更大，更有吸引力。清理壁橱，移除笨重的未使用的家具，并重新安排剩余的部件，以充分利用空间。</p>
<h3 id="_10">彻底清洁<a class="headerlink" href="#_10" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>清洁的房屋对买家更具吸引力。地板，窗户，墙壁，门，踢脚板......一切！在买家的心中，浴室和厨房是必须要满足要求的地方，需格外留意。</p>
<h3 id="_11">在合理范围内尽可能修复<a class="headerlink" href="#_11" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>漏水的水龙头，发出吱吱声或不能正常关闭的门，以及天花板上的小裂缝等等。漏水的屋顶或地下室一定要修好。如果出现不安全的电气问题，你也必须解决这个问题。</p>
<h3 id="_12">去个性化<a class="headerlink" href="#_12" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>请记住，您希望买家走进您的房子，感觉这是他们的家，而不是您的家！他们不想看到你杂乱的家庭肖像墙，冰壶奖杯或古怪家居装饰。</p>
<h3 id="_13">永远不要低估油漆的力量<a class="headerlink" href="#_13" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>墙壁上的强烈色彩或野性壁纸使买家难以产生购买欲。用明亮，中性的颜色重新粉刷，这将使房间看起来更大，更有吸引力。除了打扫房屋外，油漆是增加房屋吸引力和吸引优惠的最具成本效益的方式。</p>
<h3 id="_14">适当做些美化<a class="headerlink" href="#_14" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>换掉破旧的窗帘，</li>
<li>墙上的镜子将帮助房间感觉更大</li>
<li>室内植物将增加吸引力</li>
<li>修剪树木，花园除草，并种植一些新花</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="_15">权衡改进成本与潜在回报<a class="headerlink" href="#_15" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>绘画，小修理和适度的景观美化是物有所值的投资</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="5">步骤5：签署售房协议。<a class="headerlink" href="#5" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>“上市协议”授权房地产经纪人营销和出售您的房屋，该协议有三个目的：</p>
<ul>
<li>定义关系：您的工作的每个细节，包括房地产经纪人权限的限制，都将被明确定义。</li>
<li>提供有关房屋的详细信息: 这些信息可以放在MLS多重上市系统中，以帮助潜在买家找到您。</li>
<li>买家起草报价合同的基础：任何正式报价均以上市协议开始为基础。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6">步骤6：确定要价。<a class="headerlink" href="#6" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>正确的要价会吸引买家的注意力</p>
<h3 id="_16">目标是公平的市场价值<a class="headerlink" href="#_16" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>**市场价值**是指购买者愿意为您的房产支付的最高金额。记住，买家永远在比较！</p>
<h3 id="_17">过低的价格<a class="headerlink" href="#_17" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>**设置太低的价格**意味着你可能会错过一些应得的收益。</p>
<h3 id="_18">拒绝太高的价格<a class="headerlink" href="#_18" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>**设置过高的价格**会吓跑愿意购买者，并将您的房屋留在市场上太久。当您降低价格时，人们可能会认为您面临出售的压力，并进一步降低报价。</p>
<p>经纪人了解您当地市场的情况以及可能影响您出售房屋的行业趋势，他们使用专门为他们提供的大量信息以保证定价尽量准确。</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="7">第7步：营销<a class="headerlink" href="#7" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>您已经整理了待售房屋，记住它永远不会变成最好，现在是你的房地产经纪人做他们的事情的时候了。</p>
<h3 id="_19">出售标志<a class="headerlink" href="#_19" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>尽管我们实现了技术的飞跃，但销售标志仍然是一种有效的广告宣传方式。任何回应你的标志的人都是坚实的领导，因为他们亲眼看到了你的家。</p>
<h3 id="_20">传统媒体<a class="headerlink" href="#_20" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>房地产经纪人可以选择以下任何或所有：报纸上的分类广告，房地产出版物中的广告以及传单。</p>
<h3 id="_21">互联网的力量<a class="headerlink" href="#_21" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>如果您决定将房屋列入房地产委员会的MLS系统，您也可以在REALTOR.ca（加拿大最受欢迎和最值得信赖的房地产网站）上宣传您的房屋。</p>
<h3 id="_22">房地产经纪人开放房屋<a class="headerlink" href="#_22" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>房地产经纪人开放日是吸引房地产经纪人亲眼看到你家的有效方式。如果您的房屋非常适合他们的买家，他们会立即告诉他们。</p>
<h3 id="_23">买家开放日<a class="headerlink" href="#_23" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>许多买家在开始与房地产经纪人合作之前想要了解您的情况，这就是开放日对公众如此重要的原因，他们通常在周六或周日持续几个小时。</p>
<h2 id="8">步骤8：找个律师。<a class="headerlink" href="#8" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>与购买房屋时的情况类似，让律师处理所有易手的法律文件至关重要。房地产经纪人还可以为您提供您所在地区经验丰富的房地产律师的姓名。律师将审核需要您签名的重要文件，其中最关键的是买方提交的“报价邀约”。</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="9">步骤9：谈判<a class="headerlink" href="#9" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>这是一个令人兴奋的，往往是情绪化的过程，所以要做好准.</p>
<p><strong>房地产经纪人将引导完成整个过程</strong></p>
<h3 id="_24">无条件购买邀约<a class="headerlink" href="#_24" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>这意味着买方准备无条件地购买房屋， 显示了买房的诚意和实力，卖方应该珍惜。</p>
<h3 id="_25">有条件的购买邀约<a class="headerlink" href="#_25" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>通常意味着购买有一个或多个条件，例如“房屋检查”，“需要融资”， 或卖出原住房等。除非满足所有条件，否则不出售房屋。</p>
<h3 id="_26">接受邀约<a class="headerlink" href="#_26" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>卖方可选择接受，拒绝或还价。还价可能与价格，交割日期或其他合同因素有关。这个过程可以来回多次，直到双方达成协议或任何一方终止谈判。</p>
<h3 id="_27">处理邀约的三个选项<a class="headerlink" href="#_27" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>接受邀约</mark></strong>：得到了你希望的价格，甚至更多！截止日期看起来不错！没有繁琐的条件！！ 卖！！！</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>拒绝邀约</mark></strong>：邀约和期望值相去甚远，判断出对方缺少诚意，不要浪费时间和精力，直接种植谈判。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>修改邀约</mark></strong>：接近期望，但有些不太对劲，现在通过“退回”开始新一轮的谈判。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="_28">谈判的艺术<a class="headerlink" href="#_28" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>成功的谈判是让您和买家对结果感到满意的谈判，这是一个非常激动人心的时刻！</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="10_1">步骤10：合同交割<a class="headerlink" href="#10_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>谈判成功，您就拥有了一份具有法律约束力的协议。但房子真的卖了吗？ 还没有，现在是所谓“合同交割”的时候了。</p>
<h3 id="_29">合同审议及房屋过户<a class="headerlink" href="#_29" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>完成交易涉及许多复杂且耗时的法律操作，这就是你聘请专业人士的原因， 经纪人和律师完成大部份余下的工作。</p>
<h3 id="_30">交割清单<a class="headerlink" href="#_30" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>你自己还有很多工作要做，这里有一份清单：</p>
<ol>
<li>联系您的律师并通知他们已签署协议，确保他们已准备好交割事宜。</li>
<li>立即开始满足协议条款需要您采取的行动，他们有确定的完成日期，如果不这样做可能会导致很多麻烦，甚至破坏整个交易。</li>
<li>如果买方继续承担您的抵押贷款，请通知您的律师和贷款机构。</li>
<li>联系公用事业，电话和有线电视公司，了解有关转移或取消服务，您的律师通常会处理公用事业的转移。</li>
<li>致电您的保险代理人并安排取消或转让您作为房主的保险。如果您销售的房屋空置超过2或3天，请确保通知您的保险公司。</li>
<li>联系搬家公司，安排您在截止日期或之前搬家。</li>
<li>发送更改地址通知并告知邮局，通知交通部关于您的驾驶执照和注册的新地址。</li>
<li>如果您的财产或情况发生任何变化，请立即通知您的房地产经纪人。</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="_31">联系律师<a class="headerlink" href="#_31" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><mark><strong>按揭：</strong></mark>
如果您计划通过出售收益“解除”或偿还抵押贷款，您的律师将从您的贷方获得一份声明，显示您在抵押贷款中的未结余额，以及您在解除抵押贷款时必须支付的任何罚金。</p>
<p><mark><strong>交割前几天</strong></mark>:您的律师会要求您签署文件，以便将所有权转移给买方。</p>
<p><mark><strong>交割日</strong></mark>:您的律师将收到并分配销售所得款项，还清您的抵押贷款和其他费用，并给您一笔净收益支票。</p>

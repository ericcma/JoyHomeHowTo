As a first step towards this strategic direction, CorHealth plans on initiating a Quality Performance Measurement & Monitoring (QPMM) Cycle with all 20 advanced cardiac programs in Ontario to provide a platform for regular measuring and monitoring of quality metrics for cardiac care across the province.
